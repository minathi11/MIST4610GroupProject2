## Dataset Description
We have created two models from the data we obtained from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset. The data includes information about car crashes in the state of Maryland. The first model shows the total count of crashes for each month of the year. The two bar charts in each month section represent constant speed crashes vs non-constant speed crashes. Each bar is colored to represent the three different injury levels of each crash - no apparent injury, possible injury, and suspected minor injury.

The second model is a geographical representation of every crash within the dataset. It shows crash hotspots and could be used to find intersections or portions of roads that have an above average crash rate. The data is further filtered by separating each crash based upon whether or not the driver was in some state of impairment. 

## Our Two Questions Explained
1. How do the frequency and severity of car crashes vary over different months in Maryland, and are there specific patterns associated with levels of injury severity to drivers when the cars are “moving at a constant speed” vs when they are not “moving at a constant speed”?

We chose this question because it highlights an important difference in the data. Cars that are moving at a constant speed should be safer than a car constantly changing speeds, and this should affect the data. In addition, the visualization will show if the time of year impacts the frequency and severity of car crashes in Maryland.

2. What are the geographic hotspots for car crashes in Maryland, and how do these locations of crashes correlate with the driver of the vehicles being impaired or under the influence vs not being impaired?

We chose this question because if there are geographical hotspots for car crashes, then maybe something can be changed about the intersection/etc to fix the issue. We also chose to incorporate data whether the individual was impaired at the time of the accident. This could highlight specific hotspots that may be close to local bars.## Our Two Questions Explained
## Data Set Manipulations
For our first question, we had to create a calculated field utilizing the "Vehicle Movement" field. This field had 23 domains, which included: 
- ACCELERATING
- BACKING
- CHANGING LANES
- DRIVERLESS MOVING VEH.
- ENTERING TRAFFIC LANE
- LEAVING TRAFFIC LANE
- MAKING LEFT TURN
- MAKING RIGHT TURN
- MAKING U TURN
- MOVING CONSTANT SPEED
- N/A
- NEGOTIATING A CURVE
- OTHER
- PARKED
- PARKING
- PASSING
- RIGHT TURN ON RED
- SKIDDING
- SLOWING OR STOPPING
- STARTING FROM LANE
- STARTING FROM PARKED
- STOPPED IN TRAFFIC LANE
- UNKNOWN
  
Because we wanted to analyze the difference in crash severity between a car moving at a constant speed and a car moving at a non-constant speed, we had to condense all of these domains into two categories in a new calculated field named "Constant or Non-Constant Speed?" The two categories included:
- CONSTANT SPEED
- NON-CONSTANT SPEED
  
The calculation to arrive at this result is as follows:

IF [Vehicle Movement] = 'UNKNOWN' OR [Vehicle Movement] = 'N/A' THEN NULL 
ELSEIF [Vehicle Movement] = 'MOVING CONSTANT SPEED'
THEN 'CONSTANT SPEED'
ELSE 'NON-CONSTANT SPEED'
END

When using this calculated field in our model, we filtered out domains such as "UNKNOWN", "N/A", "OTHER", and any null values to make our model more accurate.

For our second question, we had to create a similar calculated field from the "Driver Substance Abuse" field. This field had 12 members, which included:
- ALCOHOL CONTRIBUTED
- ALCOHOL PRESENT
- COMBINATION CONTRIBUTED
- COMBINED SUBSTANCE PRESENT
- ILLEGAL DRUG CONTRIBUTED
- ILLEGAL DRUG PRESENT
- MEDICATION CONTRIBUTED
- MEDICATION PRESENT
- N/A
- NONE DETECTED
- OTHER
- UNKNOWN
  
Since we wanted to compare impaired car accidents versus non-impaired car accidents, we created a calculated field named "Impaired or Non-Impaired" with two members that included:
- NO IMPAIRMENT
- IMPAIRED
  
The calculation to arrive at this result is as follows:

IF [Driver Substance Abuse] = 'UNKNOWN' OR [Driver Substance Abuse] = 'N/A' THEN NULL
ELSEIF[Driver Substance Abuse] = 'NONE DETECTED'
THEN 'NO IMPAIRMENT'
ELSE 'IMPAIRED'
END

When applying this calculated field to our models, we filtered out "N/A", "OTHER", "UNKOWN", and any null values to make the results more accurate.

## Analysis & Results

The most obvious result of this analysis is that the frequency of non-constant speed car crashes is always higher than the frequency of constant speed crashes, indicating that variable speeds contribute to a higher risk of crashes across all severity categories. This result makes sense, as it is much more likely for a car to be turning, accelerating, or decelerating as opposed to driving at a constant speed when in an accident. 

The only correlation we see between injury severity and car movement is that "Possible Injury" is generally slightly higher in car accidents with non-constant speeds. 

Finally, the visualization shows us that car accidents tend to occur more in the winter months of the year. This makes sense in Maryland, as driving conditions are most likely more dangerous in the winter, leading to more accidents. A more in-depth analysis of the data reveals that certain months, such as December and January, could show a marked increase in the incidence of non-constant speed crashes, which may be attributed to holiday travel and adverse weather conditions.

In our second data visualization, the most noticible trend is that car crashes are much more frequent in areas closer to D.C., which makes sense as many more cars would be driving in this area as opposed to further outside of the city.

A second observation that can be made from this data is that there is a relatively high number of accidents caused by driver impairment when compared to preexisting notions. While there are more non-impaired driver accidents, there is a very noticeable and measurable amount of impaired driver accidents among the data.

While this is a high overview of the entire data map, a closer observation allows for crash data visualization along specific roads, which can be seen on some parts of the map already. It is evident that impaired driver accidents concentrate closer to the city, and taper off along roads that lead further away. This may be due to the fact that many more bars, restaurants, and alcohol serving locations are located closer to D.C. as opposed to further away.The clustering of accidents in the central region potentially reflects a higher density of vehicular activity in urban areas. The heat map illustrates a gradient of accident frequency, with a pronounced concentration in the city center that could correlate with rush hour traffic and a higher density of intersections.
